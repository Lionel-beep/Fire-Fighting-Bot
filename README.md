# Fire-Fighting-Bot

The firefighting bot proves to be a major savior in
times of serious emergencies like a fire breakout in
a building. In most cases, fire accidents tend to
become fatal due to the lack of presence of mind
amidst the pressure, nervousness and anxiety and
the second reason being lack of clever resources.

• The robot allows us to have a live panoramic view
of the surrounding which can be monitored from a
safe place.
• It also has an inbuilt object detection feature which
proves effective for escorting out trapped people
from corners where human help cannot reach and
also helps in detecting pocket fires which can turn
out to be fatal. This is the main key feature which
helps to save anyone trapped in the building. People

detected through the robot are rescued immediately
through fire rescue teams and taken care of.
• Another important aspect in case of a fire breakout
is the source of the fire. Unless, we know the source
it’s impossible to extinguish the fire. The
firefighting bot can help curb that issue as well.
• In case of a fire the main problem becomes that
many people who are trapped amidst the smoke fail
to reach out and are never found. This robot solves
this problem too.
